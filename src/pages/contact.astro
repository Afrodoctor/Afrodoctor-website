              <p>
                In our pursuit of equitable access to quality health services, we encountered challenges in reaching and including several vulnerable groups who are in great need but at high risk of being left out. These groups include young women and persons with disabilities (PWDs).
              </p>

              <p>
                National reports have highlighted gaps in health service access within traditional health systems for these groups — including physical accessibility hurdles, lack of inclusivity, discrimination, lack of privacy, and fear of judgement — which puts them at an increased risk of being left out, yet they need quality health services as others do.
              </p>

              <p>
                Novel and context-specific digital innovations such as the Afrodoctor mobile application and Afrodoctor HMS software can help bridge the health system gaps mentioned. However, these populations also face additional individual challenges to access quality health services, including inadequate knowledge and skills in using digital platforms, lack of digital gadgets, and poverty which limits their ability to purchase data bundles and engage meaningfully with the health system.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the Afrodoctor Foundation, we address these individual barriers by building digital skills and health utilization capacity among young women and PWDs, and by providing internet connectivity and devices to these vulnerable groups.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you donate, you support the scaling up of training, provision of digital gadgets, and mobile data to these groups. You also enable free medical appointment booking and consultations for people in great need who cannot afford services.
